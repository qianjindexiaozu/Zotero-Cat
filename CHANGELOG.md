# Changelog

[English](./CHANGELOG.md) | [中文](./CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md)

All notable project changes are tracked here. Zotero-Cat uses `0.x`
versions until the first public stability commitment.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- Zotero item-pane assistant section with localized chat UI.
- OpenAI-compatible provider support with streaming output, endpoint probing,
  endpoint fallback, model list fetching, and provider-declared reasoning
  effort controls.
- Zotero context injection for item metadata, notes, PDF annotations, selected
  PDF text, and request-scoped custom context.
- Per-item conversation history with Zotero-pref persistence, active session
  tracking, and hard capacity limits.
- API Key storage through Firefox Login Manager.
- Diagnostics panel for retry, model-list, timeout, cancellation, and provider
  errors.
- Shared pure-logic modules for model metadata parsing, conversation storage,
  item scoping, retry classification, runtime IDs, and agent message types.
- Automated tests for provider fallback, model probing, context preview,
  conversation persistence parsing, streaming delta parsing, and startup.
- Release documentation for installation, provider setup, privacy, versioning,
  tagging, and manual compatibility gates.

### Changed

- Packaged add-on compatibility is restricted to Zotero 9 for the first
  release candidate: `strict_min_version` is `9.0` and `strict_max_version` is
  `9.*`.
- GitHub release workflow now runs lint, build, tests, and artifact upload
  directly in this repository before publishing on `v*` tags.

### Release Notes

- Zotero 10 beta compatibility is intentionally not declared until the manual
  UI checklist has been run against the current Zotero beta line.
- Packaged-XPI install and persistence checks must be recorded before a public
  GitHub release is tagged.
